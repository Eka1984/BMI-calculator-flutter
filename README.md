# BMI Calculator

This is a BMI Calculator project built using Flutter as part of Angela Yu's Udemy course, [The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

## Description

The BMI Calculator is a simple application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The app follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, features multiple pages for user interaction, and separates constants into a dedicated file for better organization and maintainability. Additionally, it uses customized widgets to enhance reusability and maintain a clean codebase.
